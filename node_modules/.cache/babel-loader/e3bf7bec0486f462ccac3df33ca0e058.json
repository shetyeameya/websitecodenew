It runs the database in the application and display the amount of calories for the item/items purchased by just accessing the items mentioned in the bill. Used an OCR that is Tesseract, with the help of SQLite to check the database. Used Coredata and AVFoundation . Language used for the project was Objective C. \\nCHAT APP: Developed a simple user chat application where the user can connect with his friends using the same application through Bluetooth. Language used was objective C. \\nFOLLOWER: This application helps the user remember the people it is following and the people that are following the user. Created a database using Parse and Heroku. The user can follow or un-follow any user. It was similar to the Instagram following mechanism. Language used was Swift.  \\nWEATHER APP: Using the tableView, datasource and delegate created an open weather API which would continuously be updating it self in the background to receive current updates. Used Alamofire to download data from API.  \\nDICE GAME: Built a simple guessing game in which the user has to correctly predict the number on the dice. The user can bet 5 or 10$ also he has to choose if the number will be an odd or an even number. Alerts have been used to keep the game more interactive and fun. Used Coredata, CoreAudio.

The code was written in objective C. \nCollaborated with UI and UX team to make application user friendly by designing the icons used in the application. \nContributed to the design and development of mobile software libraries using Maxima and KDE frameworks. \nCreated efficient and fast front-ends for our consumer site, partner portals, and monetization system and maximized the speed by 15%.  \nProduction and Marketing- Dealt with Product Management and coordinated with international teams to promote the products and carry out the orders in organized manner and helping the marketing team with the technical aspects.

It runs the database in the application and display the amount of calories for the item/items purchased by just accessing the items mentioned in the bill. Used an OCR that is Tesseract, with the help of SQLite to check the database. Used Coredata and AVFoundation . Language used for the project was Objective C. \nCHAT APP: Developed a simple user chat application where the user can connect with his friends using the same application through Bluetooth. Language used was objective C. \nFOLLOWER: This application helps the user remember the people it is following and the people that are following the user. Created a database using Parse and Heroku. The user can follow or un-follow any user. It was similar to the Instagram following mechanism. Language used was Swift.  \nWEATHER APP: Using the tableView, datasource and delegate created an open weather API which would continuously be updating it self in the background to receive current updates. Used Alamofire to download data from API.  \nDICE GAME: Built a simple guessing game in which the user has to correctly predict the number on the dice. The user can bet 5 or 10$ also he has to choose if the number will be an odd or an even number. Alerts have been used to keep the game more interactive and fun. Used Coredata, CoreAudio.
