It has everything you need to analyze connection problems and find any computer \nconnected to your network that should not be there. The language used for the project was swift. It provides services such\nas Ping, Traceroute and WoL (Wake on LAN), among many others. The prototype of mobile learning application storyboard \nthat I worked on: The main module menu of the application. User may click on any preferable choices. The storyboard design \nused auto layout. The components module needed to make simple network connection before user can do basic configuration on\nrouter and switch. When user clicks each component there will be explanation for each component. Designing the explaining \ncode was my task. The tutorial module that provides step-by-step process on how to do basic configurations on router and \nswitch. All basic configuration commands will be shown here so user can easily learn how to implement them.  \nJira was used for the testing purpose.  \n`\nconst text4 = `\nWorking on a new stock Exchange application. It helps the user to check his spending’s on stocks and helps him to maintain \nhis account. Swift is the major language used, a bridging header is created between objective C and swift for the yahoo \nfinance API. Created an authentication page for an application as a prototype using Google Firebase. \nFeatures: Navigation Controlled, session management. \nThe user can follow the stocks he likes and keep getting the updates through push notifications using DNS server.  \nThe data is stored using Parse open source DB. \nYahoo Finance API is used for machine learning. Machine Learning: The code compares the user stocks and finds the \nrelative stocks, which have the same value. \nMaintain and debugging for any errors. An example, the bug that showed the user number of stocks, which were not \nnecessarily of the same value. Improved the user needs by finding the right match based on user likes and fluctuating \nmarket value of the followed stocks. \nBuilt the entire application from scratch. Using auto layouts and advanced features in swift 3.0.  \nWorked on the carplay and iOS watch.  \n`\nconst text5 = `I joined as Jr Developer for iOS mobile development. \nThe entire code was in objective-C. At first it was a bit difficult as I had worked with \nswit and had a fair knowledge in objective-C. This helped me gain much more experience than \nI could ever gain. We then moved onto React. This was totally new to me. I have now in a year, \nlearned and worked on React. While learning React I was also promoted to the position of \nProject manager. Here I dealt with 24 developers offshore. Working strange hours and \ncoping with stress has prepared me for any situation that may arise. My role as a project \nmanager dealt with handling Jira, getting the right content for developing, managing assets, \nhandling issues and changes that were presented during the course all along while coding. \nI also learned that only hard work helps you achieve the targets. Now I am working as ReactJS \nand Native developer and back to coding, my passion. While working on react I have worked on various projects in Rumbleon, \nMobile version V2, web version RumbleonClassifieds.com V2 and V3, Rumbleon.com V2 and V3. Currently working on an internal tool\nfor dealers V3. `\n\n\nclass WorkPlay extends Component{\n  \n    state = {\n        loading: false,\n        showVjpg: false,\n        showAjpg: false,\n
