That which started in high \n                                school at St Marys took me to the Ruia Junior Engineering College and then I enrolled for an \n                                undergraduate education in Electronics from KC College of Engineering. Which led me to \n                                Southern Methodist University for my masters.My journey of learning had just begun!\n                                After graduating and receiving my degree I joined Webspun LLC. and learnt a lot. \n                                I build an iOS application from scratch which helped investors get all the necessary \n                                information on stocks publicly listed. After a year I joined RumbleOn and it has been an \n                                exhilarating experience. I joined as Jr Developer for iOS mobile development. \n                                The entire code was in objective-C. At first it was a bit difficult as I had worked with \n                                swit and had a fair knowledge in objective-C. This helped me gain much more experience than \n                                I could ever gain. We then moved onto React. This was totally new to me. I have now in a year, \n                                learned and worked on React. While learning React I was also promoted to the position of \n                                Project manager. Here I dealt with 24 developers offshore. Working strange hours and \n                                coping with stress has prepared me for any situation that may arise. My role as a project \n                                manager dealt with handling Jira, getting the right content for developing, managing assets, \n                                handling issues and changes that were presented during the course all along while coding. \n                                I also learned that only hard work helps you achieve the targets.
