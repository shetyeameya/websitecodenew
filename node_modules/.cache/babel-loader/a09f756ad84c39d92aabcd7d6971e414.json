My role as a project manager dealt with handling Jira, getting the right content for developing, managing assets, handling issues and changes that were presented during the course all along while coding. I also learned that only hard work helps you achieve the targets. Now I am working as ReactJS and Native developer and back to coding, my passion.\n                            </p>\n                        </Col>\n                    </Row> \n                    <Row>\n                        <Col align=\"left\" span={8}>\n                            <img className=\"curimg\" alt=\"romeonme2\" src={romeonme2} />\n                        </Col>\n                        <Col align=\"center\" span={8}>\n                            <img className=\"curimg\" alt=\"romeo\" src={romeo} />\n                        </Col>\n                        <Col align=\"right\" span={8}>\n                            <img className=\"curimg\" alt=\"romeonme1\" src={romeonme1} />\n                        </Col>\n                    </Row> \n                    <Row className=\"sourcepad\">\n                        <Col align=\"center\">\n                            <p>Source of Happiness!!!</p>\n                        </Col>\n                    </Row>  \n                    <Row>\n                        <Col>\n                            <p>\n                                Today, as I look back, I feel I have come a long way from being an inquisitive little child.What is more, today, apart from academic excellence the requirement for an all round personality of a professional is a must and of course an added advantage. Sure footed and focused as a student I have been captain of senior school, winning the All Round Student award multiple times. Passionate about sports I have been an avid player of football and cricket winning several awards and certificates. I have also had the fine privilege of being the General Coordinator of the technical and cultural festival of my college. As the Cultural General Coordinator, I worked diligently to prove my mettle and earn accolades for myself. All these activities have indicated my diverse choices for work. I look upon all these experiences as opportunities where I could gauge my own plusses and areas where I needed to enhance my output. This apart, participation in many co-curricular activities has added a positive note to my character. \n                            </p>\n                        </Col>  \n                    </Row>\n                    <Row gutter={8}>\n                        <Col align=\"center\" span={8}> <img className=\"curimg\" alt=\"graduation\" src={graduation} /></Col>\n                        <Col align=\"center\" span={8}> <img className=\"curimg\" alt=\"keeping\" src={keeping} /> </Col>  \n                        <Col align=\"center\" span={8}> <img className=\"curimg\" alt=\"trophy\" src={trophy} /></Col>  \n                    </Row>\n                    <Row className=\"sourcepad\">\n                            <Col align=\"center\"><ReactPlayer url={video} playing loop=\"true\" volume=\"1\"/></Col> \n                    </Row>\n                    <Row className=\"sourcepad\">\n                        <Col>\n                            <p className=\"paratext\">\n                                For the future I aspire to carve a strong and secure position for myself in this highly challenging, competitive yet rewarding field.
